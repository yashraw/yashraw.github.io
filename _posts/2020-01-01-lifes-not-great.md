<p>20th January 2021 was an important day of the year as it was a cousinâ€™s wedding. This day unknowingly was a turning point of all the emotions I felt.<br><br>Below is the note I wrote on 15th Jan where my mind was filled with emotions.</p>

<p><br><br>It's only when you've passed through that moment, you start to think analytically about it. Many great minds excel at thinking analytically while being in the situation, I desire to possess that skill hopefully someday. </p>

> "When someone is searching," said Siddhartha, "then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal. Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes."
_- Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha_

<p>I don't know where I'm going with this honestly... I planned the starting, but not ending of this draft, and isn't life's exactly about that? You never know what's about to come or when? Many great minds spent their entire life finding the meaning of life, spirituals they call themselves, Still, they often miss out on feeling life, and this what I felt, It's tough to explain in words what I felt that day, but it refueled my energy to its fullest, It was like a whole new level of energy I had within, this might also be the result of spending time with family and with a few good companies. </p>

<p style="line-height:1.5">This might look incoherent and that's exactly what it is, It was written combining all the short notes which I jot down as the thoughts came, because someone close to me once told me to experiment with venting out. </p>
