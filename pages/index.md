#### Welcome to my internet home. I'm a Mechanical Engineer, passionate about technology, and someone who tries to capture the world in a frame :camera:. 

<br>

#### Recent grad from Mechanical Engineering Technology - Industrial from [Centennial College](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/) and a mechanical designer | R&D Researcher working at [WIMTACH](https://wimtach.centennialcollege.ca/about/). I moved to Canada after working as a Jr. Design Engineer for a Pharma Equipment Manufacturing firm for almost a year. My goal now is to learn how to build machines and manage industry in an efficient way.

#### I created this site using [GH-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) as an extension to my resume and to build my online presence. Here, I showcase my projects, blogs and various things in a more thorough form.

#### Check out my [about page](./about/) to know more about me.
