#### Welcome to my internet home. I'm a Mechanical Engineer, passionate about technology, and someone who tries to capture the world in a frame :camera:. 

<br>

#### Hello, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** ðŸ‘‹, a mechanical engineer graduate and a technology enthusiast. I completed the Mechanical Engineering Technology - Industrial program at [Centennial College](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/) and currently working as a Jr. Process Engineer for PowerCor, a [Linamar](https://www.linamar.com/) facility. In this role, I optimize the production processes and ensure quality standards by applying my skills and knowledge. I also have a passion for designing and photography and a person having a constant growth and learning mindset.

#### I created this site using [GH-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) as an extension to my resume and to build my online presence. Here, I showcase my projects, blogs and various things in a more thorough form.

#### Check out my [about page](./about/) to know more about me.
