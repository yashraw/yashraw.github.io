#### Welcome to my internet home. I'm a Mechanical Engineer, passionate about technology, and someone who tries to capture the world in a frame :camera:. 

<br>

#### Currently enrolled in Mechanical Engineering Technology - Industrial from [Centennial College](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/) and a student researcher and mechanical designer working part-time at [WIMTACH](https://wimtach.centennialcollege.ca/about/). I moved to Canada after working as a Jr. Design Engineer for a Pharma Equipment Manufacturing firm for almost a year. My goal now is to learn how to build machines and manage industry in an efficient way. I am employed Part Time 


<br>

#### I created this site using [GH-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) as an extension to my resume and to build my online presence. Here, I showcase my projects, blogs and various things in a more thorough form.

<br>

#### Also enrolled in [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) â€” an online introductory course on Computer Science taught at Harvard University by [David J. Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/)
