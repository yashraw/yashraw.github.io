#### Welcome to my internet home. I'm a Mechanical Engineer, passionate about technology, and likes to capture the world.

<br>

#### I created this site using [GH-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) to build my online presence. Here, I showcase my projects, blogs and various things in a more thorough form.

<br>

#### I recently decided to pursue Advanced diploma in Industrial Engineering after working for over 10 months in a Pharma Equipment Manufacturing company as a Design Engineer. My goal now is to learn how to build machines and manage industry in an efficient way.
