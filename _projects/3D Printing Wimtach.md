## My Experience with Rapid Prototyping with WIMTACH and How I Saved Over 8 Hours of Printing Time.

When working at WIMTACH Centennial College, I was tasked with making some design modifications to the PCB case. I wanted to use 3D printing to make the case, so I designed it in SolidWorks based on the dimensions of the PCB.

However, when I received the PCB, I realized that it was slightly different from the original specifications and the mounting holes and locations were different, so I had to modify the case design accordingly. I opened the SolidWorks file and adjusted the measurements to fit the new PCB. Then I exported the file to my slicing software, which prepares the 3D model for printing.

To my surprise, the software estimated that it would take 8 hours to print the case, which was much longer than I expected. Instead of printing it fully, I created an ‘essential-only’ version of the model which just included the parts that would verify the overall fit and mounting holes.

It was a .6mm thickness file which meant that it would print in just 3 layers - a paper-thin model of the original one which would verify the design before committing to the 8-hour print. It took me less than 20 minutes to create that design and saved me over 8 hours of printing time.

What kind of tricks/hacks do you use to save your time at the workplace?
