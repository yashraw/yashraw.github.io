The objective of this project was to develop a milling fixture that would accurately align and position parts for the initial machining process, as well as secure the part in an angled position for a subsequent machining operation.

#### Objectives

- To utilize SolidWorks CAD software to design a fixture that would meet the specific project requirements while minimizing the need for in-house machining. By utilizing readily available parts and incorporating them into the design, we aimed to increase efficiency and reduce production costs. Through the use of advanced 3D modeling techniques, collaboration with classmates and a professor, a functional and safe design was successfully created.

The CAD drawings of the project is shown below.

#### Result Analysis

As a student in my 2nd semester of "Tool Design" at college, I had the opportunity to design a milling fixture as an assignment. This experience allowed me to learn about the principles of clamping and fixture design, including the use of clamping elements, the importance of accurate alignment, and the need for rigidity and stability to maintain precision during machining. Additionally, I learned about the specific requirements of the workpiece being machined and the capabilities of the milling machine being used.

This knowledge and experience will be invaluable in my future job as a tool designer or in any other manufacturing related positions. Understanding the principles of clamping and fixture design will enable me to design more efficient and precise fixtures for any manufacturing process. Additionally, the knowledge I gained about the specific requirements of a workpiece and the capabilities of a milling machine will allow me to better understand the manufacturing process and make more informed decisions in my future job.




**1) Advantages.**Allows for precise and efficient machining of the workpiece, it is widely used in manufacturing industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical device manufacturing.

**2) Applications.** The milling fixtures can be used for various manufacturing processes such as drilling, boring, reaming, tapping, and milling.
